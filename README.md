# Anomaly-Detection-Case-Studies
The cases here are ones used in my Anomaly Detection course. We performed Exploratory Data Analysis and 
then engineered new features to aid in the final analysis to detect anomalies in the data.

## Case 1: Financial Markets
Combined +7k data files to create a +14.8mil row x 7 column data set. After EDA I created 10 new features evaluating risk and return. The final dataset was almost 3GB and required skills in memory management and function selection to be able to work with. My laptop only has 8GB of RAM and 2 cores which limited the types of functions I could use. One example, using certain functions together to combine the data sets I was able to reduce it to 11 minutes.

## Case 2: Telemetry

## Case 3: Credit Card Transaction Fraud

## Case 4: Healthcare Fraud
